<p><h1>The Independent, UK </h1> 
<h2>'The science of stories: Learning how to tell a tale is the film industry's most important skill'. By Tim Walker, originally published in The Independent, April 12, 2012.</h2></p>

<p>"You need only study this week's cinema listings to know Hollywood is running out of stories. Wrath of the Titans is a sequel to a remake of a film based on a millennia-old Greek myth. Battleship is a movie adaptation of a board game. Mirror, Mirror is a version of Snow White, the fairytale first committed to celluloid by Walt Disney 75 years ago. Another big-budget take on the same story, Snow White and the Huntsman, comes out in June. The industry is long on "re-imaginings", but short on imagination.</p>

<p>The problem, explains story specialist Bobette Buster, is that studios are neglecting one of the most important — and cheapest — parts of the filmmaking process: development. "I see it on screen over and over again," she says. "People who have a good idea but become frustrated with the story development process and eventually just say:'It's good enough'. They think they can fix the problems later with marketing. Pixar is an exception: it takes apart its stories at least four times before putting them out and it takes the time to create a great tale, well told."</p>
